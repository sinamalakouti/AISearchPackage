# AISearchPackage


This is my Artificial Intelligence course project at AUT. 


This project mainly consists of two parts:

1-Implementing classical search algorithms such as DFS, BFS, UCS, A*, and Bidirectional algorithms (all are provided in both graph-search and tree-search versions).

2-Implementing modern search and local search algorithms such as Hill-Climbing, Genetic, and also Simulated-Annealing. 

Alongside implementing mentioned algorithms, you can find several problems which are used for testing and evaluating algorithms.
